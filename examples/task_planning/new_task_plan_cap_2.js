// Define the task description as a JavaScript string

No, you do not need to proceed with the next action in the plan if the first cap_skill_library.tighten() exits with success. 

The purpose of the plan is to ensure that the cap is tightened onto the bottle. If the first tighten action is successful, it means that the cap has already been tightened to the desired level of resistance torque. Continuing with additional tighten actions would be redundant and unnecessary, as the goal has already been achieved. 

In general, once a goal condition is met, further actions that aim to achieve the same goal are not required. This is a principle in planning and execution to avoid redundant operations and to ensure efficiency.
